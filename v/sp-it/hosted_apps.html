            <p>Our SDaaS framework (KITE & CID) offers service providers to develop captive portals - e-KYC, e-Services
                offering for digital commerce, governance, ID tracking & management systems.</p>

            <p>The SDaaS model is to help 3rd party developers build applications using software platform and get the
                results to the end customers for mutual benefit of all stakeholders. The idea itself is certainly far
                from new and goes back as long as there have been software platforms, which is pretty much since the
                beginning of computing. </p>
            <p>Over the decades, the big difference is where the focus lies; in terms of
                encouraging 3rd party developers, controlling access to the platform, and who gets paid for delivering
                the software that runs on top of it and making it accessible from the cloud for a Global Audience. </p>
