			<strong>THE SRE APPROACH IS APPROPRIATE TO ALL CLOUD USERS.</strong>
			<p>Site Reliability Engineering improves the reliability of currently running software, while minimizing the work involved maintaining it.</p>
			<p>Automating as many tasks as possible allows operations experts to provide strategic, higher-level work, such as planning a new deployment or creating a pipeline for faster product feedback.</p>
			<p>Some of the typical features of adapting site reliability engineering:<ul class="kva-list">
					
				<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Fill the gap between developer and sysadmin.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Automate the process.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Continuously monitor and analyze application performance.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Plan and maintain operational runbooks.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Contribute to overall product roadmap.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Ensure software has good logging and diagnostics.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>The goal is to bridge the gap between the development team that wants to ship things as fast as possible and the operations team that doesnâ€™t want anything to blow up in production.
